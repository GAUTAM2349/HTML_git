* In HTML, the checked attribute is used primarily with input elements of type checkbox and radio. It specifies that the checkbox or radio button should be selected (checked) by default when the page loads.

* use of value attributes depends upon cases, like 

    1> for an input tag (not textarea) , that accepts some text input , value passed to value attribute is initial value that will be
       be present in that input box, by default.
    
    2> for checkbox, radio, and option,  it is the value that will be sent, if it is selected. 


* <button type="submit" value="submitForm">Submit</button>  
* <input type="submit" value="Submit">
* <input type="button" value="Click Me">


* difference b/w button tag and input tag with type submit
    -> input tag don't have closing tag, so can make simple button with text that is present inside value attribute.
    -> but in button tag more tags can be nested hence images, icons...more styling can be applied.


* checkbox - select multiple
* radio - only one
* select

checkbox and radio does not have any parent element to get encapsulated, what logically binds them, is common "name" attribute

Note :- <select> tage have child elements with <option> tag. It is different compared to other two. it takes only singel space,
        and a dropdown open to select. SO when their are too many elements, which is logically to be selected at the same place,
        like country name .. then select should be used.
