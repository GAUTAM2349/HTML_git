* to use comment also, in jsx we need to wrap it inside {}, and then commenting is like js
* Is jsx mandatory for react ?- no we can use normal react syntax, ie. js itself, but it is for convenient. React
  can use typescript also, but that is also not compulsory, function as well as class syntax, but not any one is mandatory,
  and this makes react too flexible. 
* We can use react only in specific part also, not necessarily , if that component needs too much of stuffs so it can be made av
 ailable immediately.
* We can write component as similar to html tag <Component_name> </Component_name> , also like <Component_name/> (preffered)
  and since components are eventually a function so it can also be directly called.
* planning is necessary before H2SO4 
* React Fragment <React.Fragment></> is also a component which is imported through React. It is like an empty tag.

q. why to give name to arguments that are passed as props?
TASK :- check once does jsx takes only evaluative expression or normal for loop statement will work
